# socketio-whiteboard-container
This repository is used to build the [Socketio whiteboard example](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/tree/master/examples/whiteboard) in a container.

You can launch the Socket.io whiteboard application using the following docker
command:
```
docker run -it -p 3000:3000  quay.io/ianchakeres/socketio-whiteboard
```

After launching the container you can access the whiteboard example at `localhost:3000`.
